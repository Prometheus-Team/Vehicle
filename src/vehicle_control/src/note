- areas should be initially unexplored, then become empty or wall later

Protocols
- Wait for rescue
    - Vehicle broadcasts location and shutdown system waiting to be rescued
- Return to base
    - Vehicle returns to base

Features to implement
- Complete localization
- Make system check before starting exploration
    - Determine max speed
    - Determine speed to PWM ratio

- Validate inputs provided by user
- Implement some fail safes
    - If vehicle battery is not enough for expolration
        - Notify user battery status and wait for approval to return to base
        - If user declines and overrides warning to explore until battery is deplated
            - If battery for the motors is completely depleted, enact 'Wait for rescue' protocol
            - If battery lasts until end of expolration, enact 'Return to base' protocol

    - If vehicle battery isn't enough for return, broadcast current location notifying battery is low and shutdown system
    - If mapper isn't working, recommend return to base unless user takes manual control
    - If path finder isn't working, recommend return to base unless user takes manual control
    - If exploration isn't working, recommend return to base unless user takes manual control
    - If steering isn't working, enact 'Wait for rescue' protocol

    - If battery is depleted while returning to base, enact 'Wait for rescue' protocol
- Add led lights to show the status of the vehicle
    - Power on
    - Ready and system online - properly started the system waiting for master connection
    - Connected with master
- Add power button
